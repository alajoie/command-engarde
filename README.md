# command-engarde
a command line implementation of the tabletop game - engarde

Intended to run using Python 3.x or greater

This is a simple one player version of the tabletop game EnGarde originally created by Reiner Knizia.

The first version simply recreates the BASIC version of this game.

The infamous duelist, Comte Puter, has been terrorizing everyone who dares to pick up a sword.
Can you help bring a stop to his inhuman assaults?

BASIC RULES
The fencing piste consists of 23 spaces. 

Each fencer starts at one end of the piste.

Each fencer is dealt five cards ranging in values from 1 to 5.

At each turn, the player chooses which card strength to play.
They are then presented movement choices based upon their position on the piste, the magnitude of the card they selected,
and the distance between the fencers. Options may include, Retreat, Advance, Lunge. The player may alternately choose
to Replace the card back into his hand and select a different card, starting the process over.

Once the magnitude and action have been selected, the card is placed in the discard table, a new card is dealt from 
the deck, and the player's turn ends.

It is then the Comte's turn... 

The point continues until one of the players hits the other or until the deckis exhausted. In the case of the latter,
the point is scored against the fencer furthest from the center of the piste. (space 12)

The bout continues in this manner until one fencer or the other has received the agreed upon number of hits
(Hits are scored AGAINST each fencer... just like they were before fencing became a safe olympic sport)

Have fun and - En Garde!
